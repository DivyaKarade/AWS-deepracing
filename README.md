# AWS-deepracing

AWS deepracing (https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/) is a virtual autonomous racing league, driven by Machine Learning (ML) where one has to build ML models based on reinforcement learning and hit the tracks virtually.
In this repository i have kept my best reinforcement learning codes for AWS deepracing which helps me in national level races.
